To start off with the revolution, we agree with the goal of preserving well being of the child. However, this well being does not not only need the physical wellbeing, but it also includes mental wellbeing. And in their side we can not protect the child's mental wellbeing as much as our as I can. And also regarding what the religious cases that they're talking about. Some religious might think that their religion belief and stuff like that is like the main value and things. But in our modern society, these kind of cases where they do degrees of those actions is actually considered as child abuse. And in case of this is affecting their lives directly along with their life. And if they are actually killing people because of their religious belief of their parents, then we believe that this could be considered as child abuse cases and be treated legally so they can get the help that they need. They also talked about about the justification of supporting the legal guardianship existing appearance in the Santa's Pro. There are lots of people who discuss about who to have these legal guardianship and the reason that they decided the people who have their legal guardianship is actually their guardians and parents. We believe there is some sort of reason behind it and we will explain that further on in our arguments. To start off with, before we start off with the argument, we believe that there are two characteristics of a child. First is irrationality and the second point, which is most important is that they have their life that's about 80 or 90 years in their life. So we have to consider the amount of life that they're going to live further and think of like the best way for them to live a very wonderful life in the future. So, first argument is not the doubts of qualification. What aspect should be considered an irrational favorable decision for the child? First, we think we have to consider the medical information. The information itself is not mutually exclusive to health care experts as our due to the leader of opposition has talked about. They might have more changes that they experience, they might have more examples that they face throughout their medical life. But however, that does not guarantee 100% chance of them signing the right way because in these kind of life threatening situations, these half half where these chances are normally really dangerous. So even if they decide the best way that they can think half, it does not guarantee a perfectly great life for them and it can actually lead to death as well. So we believe that in whatever medical information or medical knowledge that they have, they do not guarantee 100% life chance for their child. And because this life is regarding their parents rather than the medical professionals themselves. We believe that we have to give a chance for the parents to decide what kind of medical procedure and what kind of things that they have to care about to talk about the second case, which is about understanding of the child's will. We believe this is the most important aspect in deciding what kind of mental treatment to do in somebody clients. So why is understanding the child's importance? Because in life certainly conditions it's only something like child cancer or zukomia or something like that, a very serious and serious disease. So in these kinds of cases, how the child feels due to each procedure is really important because it directly connects to the health and quality of life for long periods. So this isn't just over by one single surgery or some sort of like true surgery. It can take more than two years or three years and stuff like that. And normal average time period of these kind of diseases actually take two to three years. So when you're deciding something about two to three years of this entire child's life, then we believe that this child does not really want to do some sort of this procedure, or they don't feel comfortable doing this kind of medical procedures, then we have to respect their decision and their rights as well. And in the other cases about medical emergency where child's tense, they don't have any kind of consciousness, they have some sort of serious problem that they can't really decide anything. We believe throughout the life that their parents have lived with this child and throughout the times that they work with them. We believe that they can actually know directly on what kind of thoughts and values that this child has and this can be decided by their parents. Then why sometimes experts know these kind of child will. We believe this is because of the aspect that child can communicate more comfortably with their parents compared to the medical experts. The time the medical experts see the child is actually about two to three minutes per day. If they're in some sort of situation or if they're in the hospital themselves, they don't actually see the doctors more than 1 hour or longer like that. So we believe it's not enough time for the health expert to know with this child really? No thank you, what's this procedure? And stuff like that. However, in the case of guardians and parents, they are actually with them 24/7 mostly in these severe cases and they would have lived with this child for a certain amount of time. So we believe that they have a lot of knowledge regarding what the child really wants and those kind of aspects can lead to better decisions of their parents themselves. So we believe that the amount of information that the parents has compared to the medical information about their child is actually better in the case of their parents. Second, to talk about the benefits for the futures of child's life. We believe that because child actually has 80 90 years of child life left, we have to consider this really directly. In the case of parents, if they talk to above, parents inherently care the very best for their child, and if not, if they don't care about their child, that is trails and incelporately. So this is something that you're going to take it legally. It's not like something that we have to discuss. And in the case of health care at Frisky, they might only have great intentions and they might have better quality of life and stuff like that. But however, that does not mean that they can always make the best decision, as I said before. So we are the toughest in our later argument and also when we talk about the best decision of making the future life of patients. Life decisions actually normally have lots of side effects that can cause from the disease themselves. So in the case of leukemia, when they do this like this medical procedure from their brain taking out the liquid that's in the brain, if they take out the liquid, then there is a percentage of those child living a much longer life. But in this case, this child might get paralyzed. And those sort of side effects do exist in these kind of situations. So we believe we have to consider the parents opinion and what they want to choose. Whether they want to choose like paralyzed child or some sort of other side effects should be totally upon the parents, not the medical expert themselves. Because medical experts will not live with this child forever. But in the case apparently you have to live with them for another ten or 20 years. So we believe it's important to consider the family conditions and their situation because not every single family might be able to live with those child conditions because of their special reasons. And to talk about the second argument, we believe it's going to be too much better for medical experts in the case of the situation. In the case of doctors, yes, they might have great intentions as they talked about. However, doctors don't only meet like one or two patients a day, they have to meet if they're really famous, they have to meet about 100 patients a day. And that does not mean that they have enough time and think about each patient's best medical cases and each patient's great way to solve their health problems and stuff like that. So we will make these kind of value decisions when it is not about just living and dying and when it's something about deciding what kind of side effects they want and then something that we have to consider about the family issues and this child's will as well. We believe doctors can't make the best decisions for themselves and we believe that it's going to be a lot of work for the doctors because patients themselves can actually blame the doctors as well when something goes wrong and they can suffer from those kinds of extreme mental stress and stuff like that. So we believe that parents should have the legal bargainship towards these medical cases. Boosting or preserving wellbeing of children as we mentioned in our first speaker and we are telling you how parents and experts conflict when parents become emotional and parents are not parents become emotional about their children. We also gave you examples about religions when religious believers make side effects with their religion. So about this point of position to market, that how it's labeled and they would be legally restricted by government and however we looked at they are actually proving our point about how these religious religious believers parents can be dangerous. So we argue about how these religious believers can be dangerous in current school when they make side effects in surgeries and they just argue that our laws restrict them because side effects exist. We build that they're actually proving our point that side effects exist in surgeries when these believers make wrong decisions. So moving on to revoke firstly, beyond that there's no perfect situation how physical also children would not be guaranteed, therefore parents decision is needed. However, we also do agree with the point that perfect life, perfect situation cannot be guaranteed. However, we must always find best and most suitable decisions in life changing moment. So to make a best and suitable decision, we build the experts knowledge that's needed and an expert's decision that's needed. Isn't those parents know what yes, isn't. Those experts decision just about probable? Why do the parents have to understand what type of experts. There'S no reason why we tell you that expert's decision parents must believe experts decision whether they're thinking about expert's decision and I'm criticizing like parents are not able to understand experts knowledge and experts decision perfectly as efficient development. So therefore it's almost impossible for experts to talk about their knowledge about parents and help parents to make a racial decision. So doctors must make this decision perfect situation doesn't exist and we believe that these expertise experts knowledge can be necessary and moving on to their point of a mental condition. So, two layers of response were disappointed. Firstly. They argued that parents may be able to communicate with children and they will be able to make their mental health better. However, we actually cannot understand why this issue is related to this motion. We are just doing a medical surgery in this motion. So when we just operate these surgeries, it's not actually related to their mental health because we just operate surgeries. And however secondly even if we argue that these conditions are actually related, we looked at medical experts and parents can communicate each other and think about children's condition. So parents can talk about children's condition and children's opinion about the surgery, how they're feeling about the surgeries and symptoms and they can help doctors to make a right decision. So, what's the point doctors make rather than purpose? Even though doctors have expertise, even though doctors have expert knowledge, they are not able to know about these children's symptoms. A lot of the arguments so they can communicate. However, a lot of doctors talking about their expert knowledge to parents, these knowledge are too much for parents to know even though they communicate. Therefore, that parents talking about children's symptoms is much better. Moving on to their point about side effects and how they can minimize side effects during surgery when parents make the decision, we also believe that this point is not necessary to give emotion. Like the same as I argued before, even though parents know about children's symptoms, parents children's mental health, they are mature and they're not expert. So therefore, they are not able to make racial decisions rather than experts. Also, they argue that doctors are not able to focus on their patients because they don't have enough time to concentrate on patients. However. Even though they don't have enough time, normally two or three doctors check out patients condition and decide surgery's operation and doctors, they focuses their best and they use it a lot of time when it's a life changing moment. So, believe that these doctors decision would be the best decision. So, even though doctor's decision may not be perfect, these expert knowledge and these decisions are most suitable decisions for the situations. So, moving on to their point about legal guardianship, that legal guardianship is the reason for parents to submit. However, as we are good in our first reason, these parents rights can be restricted when parents decision can give a relative impact to propose. So, several years ago, there was this accident that caused a female idol member be at the risk of dying. So, there was two choices. First of all, if they puncture his neck, then there was more chance to live, but he had to lose his career. Another choice was that do not puncture the neck, but still it was preserved a career, but he may die. So you cannot many cases of the medical decisions are like this. There is a gray area where okay, some decisions may increase the probability of life, but that might totally ruin their quality of life. But however, other choices may ensure the quality of life but still may kill the patients. We believe that in the real world there are so many great areas like this. So therefore, we cannot simply say that oh, because doctors know well about the procedure, because doctors know well about the body, they can make the objective decisions. Therefore, that is a fundamental reason why we oppose assumption. So now we go on to several points of rebuttal against previous speakers. So first of all, the PM talked about how PM and the VPN have constantly talked about how these patients parents are not eligible enough to make objective decisions, rational decisions, and therefore they have to give the specifics to the doctors, to developers. However, we have constantly said that this information itself is not exclusive to the doctor itself. Why is this so? Because, as I've constantly told you in the POS, because these parents do not have to understand exactly how the body works, how the procedure works, but the only thing they need to know is the probabilities. Meaning that oh, if I puncture this neck, then maybe the life probability goes up to like 70% and it's not 20%. That is the only information that the patient parent needs to know to make rational decisions. And therefore we do not believe that there is special expertise needed in understanding that. And also because these people are medical experts, definitely these informations are already trusted by the parents, meaning that there is no problem in making informed and rational decisions in the house of parents. Another minor point the DPM talked about how the parents being able to communicate is not related to mental health. We're talking about medical procedures. So therefore we do not have to talk about mental health. And experts can still also communicate with the patient. However, we believe that we would like to practice we're not talking about mental health care itself, but however, we have to take care of. We have to see if which procedure can actually help better quality of life, actually help them make passion feel better. So therefore, we believe that their point is not true about the communication .2 layers a also presented as also presented by the PM of their own site. Many times this communication between the patients is impossible in the case of lifesaving procedures and B since the child's communicative skills are still lacking and they might have problems, we're talking with strangers, we're talking with people they do not have, bonding with people with that patient. Our parents are the best actors to communicate with these patients. So now I'll go on for a little more. So which case in malicious doctors or parents are more likely? We believe that doctors are much more likely. So we would like to divide this malicious kind of case into race. First of all, when the decision is objectively bad and second of all, the decision is not objectively bad, but still not preferable for the future life of the patients. So first of all, in the case where it is objectively starved so we believe that this itself is already an extreme minor case because we're talking about life threatening conditions. Meaning that even if this person, even if this parent is a religious, even if this parent maybe have a different kind of political stance or what if they have their child in the hands of dying, we believe that most of the parents would still make rational and beneficial choice for their child. So however, if there is a screen minor case where the parents do not care about their child, meaning that they are willing to even kill their child for their religion. Or in the case of health experts making objectively wrong decisions, we believe that they will be a subject for legal punishment, meaning they would be child abuse or medical accident. So therefore, we believe that this would be covered in those kinds of circumstances. Then how about a case where there is objectively, not unsafe objectively not killing the patient, but actually maybe not favorable for the patients? We believe that this is the major case of this today's debate because in real life most of the cases people would have these category areas rather than these crazy parents trying to kill their own child. So in the case of software, yeah, they do have job ethics. But however, because they are working as a job, working as a career, their career and money also matters in these kind of decisions, meaning that they have other incentives rather than patients life and future life policy itself. For example, let's say this procedure may have a lower chance of living and it is very hard and complicated. However, it would benefit the doctor's career if they have procedures. Yes, the parent might say that oh, that is true and safe, we cannot do that procedure. However, if the doctor has the whole responsibility to take these kind of decisions, they would be willing to make these kind of decisions. So therefore, we believe that, yes, even if they do have child ethics, because other factors also matter, it is still very risky. However, what about parents? Parents inherently care and love for their children. Nobody can say that oh, parents always kind of hate their children and they are willing to kill their children just because they do not have money, just because they hate their children. However, there are some kind of exceptions that we believe that is obligatory. For example, realistic burden. For example, let's say this procedure can save his child but leave his child paralyzed the rest of his life. Then, if the parent cannot take care of that children, then it is reasonable for that parent to say that oh, it is so sad for that child, but I have to make this kind of decision. So therefore, we believe that because doctors cannot take account of that but only care about other doctors who believe that the case of doctors not caring for the patient is more frequent and is more likely than the parents not caring about their own charge. Another point we would like to question the government what are doctors trained for in the very get go? What we mean by that is that objective decisions that they talk about cannot always be just. So what are they actually trained for? A information so that they can make diagnoses, they can narrow down the choices that patients have and B the skills in order to conduct lifesaving procedures, meaning that they are not trained for making value decisions like in the case of Lawrence or like judges do, they are only trained for the skills and information itself. So therefore, because still since they have the responsibility to inform their audience fully about the probability about many circumstances that might happen, we believe that the parents are already perfectly have the ability to make informed care and that is not mutually exclusive to these doctors. So we believe that the doctor's license itself does not ensure that this person can make the best decision for the patients at all times. Meaning, we would like to emphasize the fact that giving the decision itself, giving the ability to decide for the patient is talking about responsibility, not about information. Information itself can be shared very easily. Meaning that it is neither exclusive to any staff. So therefore, we believe that if these doctors have to be responsible for all of these choices, it's going to be they're not qualified to make responsibility rather than just advising them to make the right decisions. We believe that the gray areas would be a very big problem in their own space. So what happens? We told you in this debate, we believe, we have already told you how the information and skills at these experts yes, it is very good, but it is not exclusive. However, responsibility and communication with communication and representing the will of the patient itself is only exclusive for the parents. We believe that that is the main reason why we opposed to the solution. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Actually there are only a single gentleman from the sea. But however, just to be formal okay ladies and gentlemen, I found two questions in this debate. The first one is to like is it justifiable to allow medical experts to make decisions in life threatening circumstances of child? And second argument, second clash is about which side is beneficial to child, which side is able to provide a better wellbeing to individual child themselves. So although team, I mean opposition doesn't really seem to understand this clashes very well, let me just try to implement my logic to their cases. Okay? So first of all about Identifiability, we have to mention that because in life threatening conditions, since this is a problem matter of life and death, it is like there is extremely high possibility to be extremely complicated surgery or treatment being required, etc. For and therefore because parents are lacking about those experts has information and therefore medical experts should be on charge. And that was our first speaker of mentioned in our speech. However, inside of opposition, first of all, they mention that these medical informations are not exclusive to parents. However, for example, we all know how this heart donation or heart transplant plantation is happening. You just rip a random person's chest off and you just take their heart off and replace it to one another. Ladies and gentlemen, we don't necessarily know how risky it is or how much harder is or how painful it is for patients or etc for and therefore because don't thank you because there are lack of information, lack of experience, lack of those millions and thousands of cases that you or medical experts are getting educated in the university or college or whatnot. Therefore, this is just like the simple information the team opposition is arguing about the exact procedure or such statistical possibility of succeeding. With that this information is rather useless in hands of Paris, the harbor in hands of Paris and this is why we have we primarily believe that doctors should be taking charge. But however, the second response that came from team opposition is that the only information that parents need is possibility of succeed and that's all they need to make a decision. But however, Mr. Speaker, the statistical information cannot be applied to individual. If you know statistics and sized amount of it, you can know that this statistical information that is gathered by millions and thousands of patients are not directly implementable to the single patient. Maybe the problem is the doctor cannot numerically show exact possibility of success in terms of individual, especially in terms of child because every single child is in a different condition in an extreme degree. So this can be only judged by doctors, solely by doctors experience prediction and therefore, because parents does not have this and because parents are likely not are likely to be not considering those aspects showing parents statistical information such as surgery of this city is about 30%, would you do it to be reach out this kind of discussion and information given to Paris is not suitable in this case of life and a matter of life and death. So basically, in terms of the first crash, the only logic of team opposition is that information is not like information is not exclusive to doctors. And second of all, all we need is the statistical value of potential to see. However, ladies and gentlemen, I have previously mentioned that this two logic is pretty useless in this debate. So therefore we already took this first crash. More importantly, moving on to the second question about which side is beneficial to child, the team opposite should chose to argument in this gray zone of medical issues, for example choosing whether you're going to be paralyzed for your entire life or choosing or whether you're going to die a peaceful death. It could be like not people or people or whatever in this kind of case of greed zone this is not medical issues anymore. This rather issue of morality and ethics. It is rather a problem of principal value. So in this case so a discussion of doctor or parents would still be having our goal getting discharged. The doctor doesn't necessarily mean that this doctor would be able to do whatever they want without any discretion to the parents. If this is the case, it means the doctor it is okay for doctors to do biological experiments with their patients over time. This is not the kind of dog that we prefer however human but however in our sense of it. So this discussion of doctors and parents is still available. But however the point is at the end of the day anyway doctor would be able to do a doctor would be the ones who are discussing the final procedural response. So in this kind of cases of reason that team opposition was mainly trying to talk about because it is not mentor issues anymore but however, because this is more about morality and principal values boosted, doctors will be able to chose the best procedure resurgery or etc. For children by this discussion made with their own parents. However, furthermore we have mentioned that even if it's my parents or legal or child because the lack of aspects previously mentioned about their age, therapists or a huge amount of data and also because parents are having this heavy emotional tie with their own children, it is extremely hard for this parents to make irrational decision and therefore you set up as parents doctors should be taking place in charge where they can comparatively able to make a more objective decisions and what not. And therefore in our second argument of practicality you have mentioned that parents agreed to the doctors due to their irrational religious or personal beliefs such as your horse witnesses. In those cases, those childs they have a parent who believes in divorce witness or UNACCO or something, those childs will just simply die out because the parents of peer water opposition who never even allow a blood transaction which makes a surgery impossible to succeed in almost like 99% of the case. And therefore rather than letting those innocent nine year old, five or three year old child to die in a wife bed as possible but realistically rather than that you should choose doctors taking charge and therefore at least in Rs, innocent child will not die away. And therefore at the end of the day at least we would be able to save at least thousands of childs more than compared to more than the side of Team Opposition. And second of all in terms as I previously mentioned in terms of this great job which is the main weapon of Team opposition since we are not talking that we are not arguing about the doctor being able to do whatever they want no matter how parents care about the challenge and etc. Doctors and parents would be able to make a best choice for their child. And therefore we also brought to the folks.\", 'words': [{'text': 'First', 'start': 38630, 'end': 38794, 'confidence': 0.96, 'speaker': 'A'}, {'text': 'of', 'start': 38832, 'end': 38926, 'confidence':

government and then move on to our two main arguments. To start off with the revolution, we agree with the goal of preserving well being of the child. However, this well being does not not only need the physical wellbeing, but it also includes mental wellbeing. And in their side we can not protect the child's mental wellbeing as much as our as I can. And also regarding what the religious cases that they're talking about. Some religious might think that their religion belief and stuff like that is like the main value and things. But in our modern society, these kind of cases where they do degrees of those actions is actually considered as child abuse. And in case of this is affecting their lives directly along with their life. And if they are actually killing people because of their religious belief of their parents, then we believe that this could be considered as child abuse cases and be treated legally so they can get the help that they need. They also talked about about the justification of supporting the legal guardianship existing appearance in the Santa's Pro. There are lots of people who discuss about who to have these legal guardianship and the reason that they decided the people who have their legal guardianship is actually their guardians and parents. We believe there is some sort of reason behind it and we will explain that further on in our arguments. To start off with, before we start off with the argument, we believe that there are two characteristics of a child. First is irrationality and the second point, which is most important is that they have their life that's about 80 or 90 years in their life. So we have to consider the amount of life that they're going to live further and think of like the best way for them to live a very wonderful life in the future. So, first argument is not the doubts of qualification. What aspect should be considered an irrational favorable decision for the child? First, we think we have to consider the medical information. The information itself is not mutually exclusive to health care experts as our due to the leader of opposition has talked about. They might have more changes that they experience, they might have more examples that they face throughout their medical life. But however, that does not guarantee 100% chance of them signing the right way because in these kind of life threatening situations, these half half where these chances are normally really dangerous. So even if they decide the best way that they can think half, it does not guarantee a perfectly great life for them and it can actually lead to death as well. So we believe that in whatever medical information or medical knowledge that they have, they do not guarantee 100% life chance for their child. And because this life is regarding their parents rather than the medical professionals themselves. We believe that we have to give a chance for the parents to decide what kind of medical procedure and what kind of things that they have to care about to talk about the second case, which is about understanding of the child's will. We believe this is the most important aspect in deciding what kind of mental treatment to do in somebody clients. So why is understanding the child's importance? Because in life certainly conditions it's only something like child cancer or zukomia or something like that, a very serious and serious disease. So in these kinds of cases, how the child feels due to each procedure is really important because it directly connects to the health and quality of life for long periods. So this isn't just over by one single surgery or some sort of like true surgery. It can take more than two years or three years and stuff like that. And normal average time period of these kind of diseases actually take two to three years. So when you're deciding something about two to three years of this entire child's life, then we believe that this child does not really want to do some sort of this procedure, or they don't feel comfortable doing this kind of medical procedures, then we have to respect their decision and their rights as well. And in the other cases about medical emergency where child's tense, they don't have any kind of consciousness, they have some sort of serious problem that they can't really decide anything. We believe throughout the life that their parents have lived with this child and throughout the times that they work with them. We believe that they can actually know directly on what kind of thoughts and values that this child has and this can be decided by their parents. Then why sometimes experts know these kind of child will. We believe this is because of the aspect that child can communicate more comfortably with their parents compared to the medical experts. The time the medical experts see the child is actually about two to three minutes per day. If they're in some sort of situation or if they're in the hospital themselves, they don't actually see the doctors more than 1 hour or longer like that. So we believe it's not enough time for the health expert to know with this child really? No thank you, what's this procedure?\", 'words': [{'text': 'First', 'start': 38630, 'end': 38794, 'confidence': 0.96, 'speaker': 'A'}, {'text': 'of', 'start': 38832, 'end': 38926, 'confidence': 1.0,

case of guardians and parents, they are actually with them 24/7 mostly in these severe cases and they would have lived with this child for a certain amount of time. So we believe that they have a lot of knowledge regarding what the child really wants and those kind of aspects can lead to better decisions of their parents themselves. So we believe that the amount of information that the parents has compared to the medical information about their child is actually better in the case of their parents. Second, to talk about the benefits for the futures of child's life. We believe that because child actually has 80 90 years of child life left, we have to consider this really directly. In the case of parents, if they talk to above, parents inherently care the very best for their child, and if not, if they don't care about their child, that is trails and incelporately. So this is something that you're going to take it legally. It's not like something that we have to discuss. And in the case of health care at Frisky, they might only have great intentions and they might have better quality of life and stuff like that. But however, that does not mean that they can always make the best decision, as I said before. So we are the toughest in our later argument and also when we talk about the best decision of making the future life of patients. Life decisions actually normally have lots of side effects that can cause from the disease themselves. So in the case of leukemia, when they do this like this medical procedure from their brain taking out the liquid that's in the brain, if they take out the liquid, then there is a percentage of those child living a much longer life. But in this case, this child might get paralyzed. And those sort of side effects do exist in these kind of situations. So we believe we have to consider the parents opinion and what they want to choose. Whether they want to choose like paralyzed child or some sort of other side effects should be totally upon the parents, not the medical expert themselves. Because medical experts will not live with this child forever. But in the case apparently you have to live with them for another ten or 20 years. So we believe it's important to consider the family conditions and their situation because not every single family might be able to live with those child conditions because of their special reasons. And to talk about the second argument, we believe it's going to be too much better for medical experts in the case of the situation. In the case of doctors, yes, they might have great intentions as they talked about. However, doctors don't only meet like one or two patients a day, they have to meet if they're really famous, they have to meet about 100 patients a day. And that does not mean that they have enough time and think about each patient's best medical cases and each patient's great way to solve their health problems and stuff like that. So we will make these kind of value decisions when it is not about just living and dying and when it's something about deciding what kind of side effects they want and then something that we have to consider about the family issues and this child's will as well. We believe doctors can't make the best decisions for themselves and we believe that it's going to be a lot of work for the doctors because patients themselves can actually blame the doctors as well when something goes wrong and they can suffer from those kinds of extreme mental stress and stuff like that. So we believe that parents should have the legal bargainship towards these medical cases.\", 'words': [{'text': 'However,', 'start': 317892, 'end': 318130, 'confidence': 0.99902, 'speaker': 'A'},

their children. We also gave you examples about religions when religious believers make side effects with their religion. So about this point of position to market, that how it's labeled and they would be legally restricted by government and however we looked at they are actually proving our point about how these religious religious believers parents can be dangerous. So we argue about how these religious believers can be dangerous in current school when they make side effects in surgeries and they just argue that our laws restrict them because side effects exist. We build that they're actually proving our point that side effects exist in surgeries when these believers make wrong decisions. So moving on to revoke firstly, beyond that there's no perfect situation how physical also children would not be guaranteed, therefore parents decision is needed. However, we also do agree with the point that perfect life, perfect situation cannot be guaranteed. However, we must always find best and most suitable decisions in life changing moment. So to make a best and suitable decision, we build the experts knowledge that's needed and an expert's decision that's needed.

better. However, we actually cannot understand why this issue is related to this motion. We are just doing a medical surgery in this motion. So when we just operate these surgeries, it's not actually related to their mental health because we just operate surgeries. And however secondly even if we argue that these conditions are actually related, we looked at medical experts and parents can communicate each other and think about children's condition. So parents can talk about children's condition and children's opinion about the surgery, how they're feeling about the surgeries and symptoms and they can help doctors to make a right decision. So, what's the point doctors make rather than purpose? Even though doctors have expertise, even though doctors have expert knowledge, they are not able to know about these children's symptoms. A lot of the arguments so they can communicate. However, a lot of doctors talking about their expert knowledge to parents, these knowledge are too much for parents to know even though they communicate. Therefore, that parents talking about children's symptoms is much better. Moving on to their point about side effects and how they can minimize side effects during surgery when parents make the decision, we also believe that this point is not necessary to give emotion. Like the same as I argued before, even though parents know about children's symptoms, parents children's mental health, they are mature and they're not expert. So therefore, they are not able to make racial decisions rather than experts. Also, they argue that doctors are not able to focus on their patients because they don't have enough time to concentrate on patients.\", 'words': [{'text': 'They', 'start': 798990, 'end': 799282,

several years ago, there was this accident that caused a female idol member be at the risk of dying. So, there was two choices. First of all, if they puncture his neck, then there was more chance to live, but he had to lose his career. Another choice was that do not puncture the neck, but still it was preserved a career, but he may die. So you cannot many cases of the medical decisions are like this. There is a gray area where okay, some decisions may increase the probability of life, but that might totally ruin their quality of life. But however, other choices may ensure the quality of life but still may kill the patients. We believe that in the real world there are so many great areas like this. So therefore, we cannot simply say that oh, because doctors know well about the procedure, because doctors know well about the body, they can make the objective decisions. Therefore, that is a fundamental reason why we oppose assumption. So now we go on to several points of rebuttal against previous speakers. So first of all, the PM talked about how PM and the VPN have constantly talked about how these patients parents are not eligible enough to make objective decisions, rational decisions, and therefore they have to give the specifics to the doctors, to developers. However, we have constantly said that this information itself is not exclusive to the doctor itself. Why is this so? Because, as I've constantly told you in the POS, because these parents do not have to understand exactly how the body works, how the procedure works, but the only thing they need to know is the probabilities. Meaning that oh, if I puncture this neck, then maybe the life probability goes up to like 70% and it's not 20%. That is the only information that the patient parent needs to know to make rational decisions. And therefore we do not believe that there is special expertise needed in understanding that. And also because these people are medical experts, definitely these informations are already trusted by the parents, meaning that there is no problem in making informed and rational decisions in the house of parents. Another minor point the DPM talked about how the parents being able to communicate is not related to mental health. We're talking about medical procedures. So therefore we do not have to talk about mental health. And experts can still also communicate with the patient. However, we believe that we would like to practice we're not talking about mental health care itself, but however, we have to take care of. We have to see if which procedure can actually help better quality of life, actually help them make passion feel better. So therefore, we believe that their point is not true about the communication .2 layers a also presented as also presented by the PM of their own site. Many times this communication between the patients is impossible in the case of lifesaving procedures and B since the child's communicative skills are still lacking and they might have problems, we're talking with strangers, we're talking with people they do not have, bonding with people with that patient. Our parents are the best actors to communicate with these patients. So now I'll go on for a little more. So which case in malicious doctors or parents are more likely? We believe that doctors are much more likely. So we would like to divide this malicious kind of case into race. First of all, when the decision is objectively bad and second of all, the decision is not objectively bad, but still not preferable for the future life of the patients. So first of all, in the case where it is objectively starved so we believe that this itself is already an extreme minor case because we're talking about life threatening conditions. Meaning that even if this person, even if this parent is a religious, even if this parent maybe have a different kind of political stance or what if they have their child in the hands of dying, we believe that most of the parents would still make rational and beneficial choice for their child. So however, if there is a screen minor case where the parents do not care about their child, meaning that they are willing to even kill their child for their religion. Or in the case of health experts making objectively wrong decisions, we believe that they will be a subject for legal punishment, meaning they would be child abuse or medical accident. So therefore, we believe that this would be covered in those kinds of circumstances. Then how about a case where there is objectively, not unsafe objectively not killing the patient, but actually maybe not favorable for the patients? We believe that this is the major case of this today's debate because in real life most of the cases people would have these category areas rather than these crazy parents trying to kill their own child. So in the case of software, yeah, they do have job ethics. But however, because they are working as a job, working as a career, their career and money also matters in these kind of decisions, meaning that they have other incentives rather than patients life and future life policy itself. For example, let's say this procedure may have a lower chance of living and it is very hard and complicated. However, it would benefit the doctor's career if they have procedures. Yes, the parent might say that oh, that is true and safe, we cannot do that procedure. However, if the doctor has the whole responsibility to take these kind of decisions, they would be willing to make these kind of decisions. So therefore, we believe that, yes, even if they do have child ethics, because other factors also matter, it is still very risky. However, what about parents? Parents inherently care and love for their children. Nobody can say that oh, parents always kind of hate their children and they are willing to kill their children just because they do not have money, just because they hate their children. However, there are some kind of exceptions that we believe that is obligatory. For example, realistic burden. For example, let's say this procedure can save his child but leave his child paralyzed the rest of his life. Then, if the parent cannot take care of that children, then it is reasonable for that parent to say that oh, it is so sad for that child, but I have to make this kind of decision. So therefore, we believe that because doctors cannot take account of that but only care about other doctors who believe that the case of doctors not caring for the patient is more frequent and is more likely than the parents not caring about their own charge. Another point we would like to question the government what are doctors trained for in the very get go? What we mean by that is that objective decisions that they talk about cannot always be just. So what are they actually trained for? A information so that they can make diagnoses, they can narrow down the choices that patients have and B the skills in order to conduct lifesaving procedures, meaning that they are not trained for making value decisions like in the case of Lawrence or like judges do, they are only trained for the skills and information itself. So therefore, because still since they have the responsibility to inform their audience fully about the probability about many circumstances that might happen, we believe that the parents are already perfectly have the ability to make informed care and that is not mutually exclusive to these doctors. So we believe that the doctor's license itself does not ensure that this person can make the best decision for the patients at all times. Meaning, we would like to emphasize the fact that giving the decision itself, giving the ability to decide for the patient is talking about responsibility, not about information. Information itself can be shared very easily. Meaning that it is neither exclusive to any staff. So therefore, we believe that if these doctors have to be responsible for all of these choices, it's going to be they're not qualified to make responsibility rather than just advising them to make the right decisions. We believe that the gray areas would be a very big problem in their own space. So what happens? We told you in this debate, we believe, we have already told you how the information and skills at these experts yes, it is very good, but it is not exclusive. However, responsibility and communication with communication and representing the will of the patient itself is only exclusive for the parents. We believe that that is the main reason why we opposed to the solution.

'text': \"So first of all about Identifiability, we have to mention that because in life threatening conditions, since this is a problem matter of life and death, it is like there is extremely high possibility to be extremely complicated surgery or treatment being required, etc. For and therefore because parents are lacking about those experts has information and therefore medical experts should be on charge. And that was our first speaker of mentioned in our speech. However, inside of opposition, first of all, they mention that these medical informations are not exclusive to parents. However, for example, we all know how this heart donation or heart transplant plantation is happening. You just rip a random person's chest off and you just take their heart off and replace it to one another. Ladies and gentlemen, we don't necessarily know how risky it is or how much harder is or how painful it is for patients or etc for and therefore because don't thank you because there are lack of information, lack of experience, lack of those millions and thousands of cases that you or medical experts are getting educated in the university or college or whatnot. Therefore, this is just like the simple information the team opposition is arguing about the exact procedure or such statistical possibility of succeeding. With that this information is rather useless in hands of Paris, the harbor in hands of Paris and this is why we have we primarily believe that doctors should be taking charge. But however, the second response that came from team opposition is that the only information that parents need is possibility of succeed and that's all they need to make a decision. But however, Mr. Speaker, the statistical information cannot be applied to individual. If you know statistics and sized amount of it, you can know that this statistical information that is gathered by millions and thousands of patients are not directly implementable to the single patient. Maybe the problem is the doctor cannot numerically show exact possibility of success in terms of individual, especially in terms of child because every single child is in a different condition in an extreme degree. So this can be only judged by doctors, solely by doctors experience prediction and therefore, because parents does not have this and because parents are likely not are likely to be not considering those aspects showing parents statistical information such as surgery of this city is about 30%, would you do it to be reach out this kind of discussion and information given to Paris is not suitable in this case of life and a matter of life and death. So basically, in terms of the first crash, the only logic of team opposition is that information is not like information is not exclusive to doctors. And second of all, all we need is the statistical value of potential to see. However, ladies and gentlemen, I have previously mentioned that this two logic is pretty useless in this debate. So therefore we already took this first crash. More importantly, moving on to the second question about which side is beneficial to child, the team opposite should chose to argument in this gray zone of medical issues, for example choosing whether you're going to be paralyzed for your entire life or choosing or whether you're going to die a peaceful death. It could be like not people or people or whatever in this kind of case of greed zone this is not medical issues anymore. This rather issue of morality and ethics. It is rather a problem of principal value. So in this case so a discussion of doctor or parents would still be having our goal getting discharged. The doctor doesn't necessarily mean that this doctor would be able to do whatever they want without any discretion to the parents. If this is the case, it means the doctor it is okay for doctors to do biological experiments with their patients over time. This is not the kind of dog that we prefer however human but however in our sense of it. So this discussion of doctors and parents is still available. But however the point is at the end of the day anyway doctor would be able to do a doctor would be the ones who are discussing the final procedural response. So in this kind of cases of reason that team opposition was mainly trying to talk about because it is not mentor issues anymore but however, because this is more about morality and principal values boosted, doctors will be able to chose the best procedure resurgery or etc. For children by this discussion made with their own parents. However, furthermore we have mentioned that even if it's my parents or legal or child because the lack of aspects previously mentioned about their age, therapists or a huge amount of data and also because parents are having this heavy emotional tie with their own children, it is extremely hard for this parents to make irrational decision and therefore you set up as parents doctors should be taking place in charge where they can comparatively able to make a more objective decisions and what not. And therefore in our second argument of practicality you have mentioned that parents agreed to the doctors due to their irrational religious or personal beliefs such as your horse witnesses. In those cases, those childs they have a parent who believes in divorce witness or UNACCO or something, those childs will just simply die out because the parents of peer water opposition who never even allow a blood transaction which makes a surgery impossible to succeed in almost like 99% of the case. And therefore rather than letting those innocent nine year old, five or three year old child to die in a wife bed as possible but realistically rather than that you should choose doctors taking charge and therefore at least in Rs, innocent child will not die away. And therefore at the end of the day at least we would be able to save at least thousands of childs more than compared to more than the side of Team Opposition. And second of all in terms as I previously mentioned in terms of this great job which is the main weapon of Team opposition since we are not talking that we are not arguing about the doctor being able to do whatever they want no matter how parents care about the challenge and etc. Doctors and parents would be able to make a best choice for their child. And therefore we also brought to the folks.\", 'words': [{'text': 'So', 'start': 1634380, 'end': 1634690, 'confidence': 0.8127, 'speaker': 'D'}, {'text': 'first', 'start': 1634740, 'end': 1634954,

              " 'text': \"First of all, I would like to start off with the revolution from the government and then move on to our two main arguments. To start off with the revolution, we agree with the goal of preserving well being of the child. However, this well being does not not only need the physical wellbeing, but it also includes mental wellbeing. And in their side we can not protect the child's mental wellbeing as much as our as I can. And also regarding what the religious cases that they're talking about. Some religious might think that their religion belief and stuff like that is like the main value and things. But in our modern society, these kind of cases where they do degrees of those actions is actually considered as child abuse. And in case of this is affecting their lives directly along with their life. And if they are actually killing people because of their religious belief of their parents, then we believe that this could be considered as child abuse cases and be treated legally so they can get the help that they need. They also talked about about the justification of supporting the legal guardianship existing appearance in the Santa's Pro. There are lots of people who discuss about who to have these legal guardianship and the reason that they decided the people who have their legal guardianship is actually their guardians and parents. We believe there is some sort of reason behind it and we will explain that further on in our arguments. To start off with, before we start off with the argument, we believe that there are two characteristics of a child. First is irrationality and the second point, which is most important is that they have their life that's about 80 or 90 years in their life. So we have to consider the amount of life that they're going to live further and think of like the best way for them to live a very wonderful life in the future. So, first argument is not the doubts of qualification. What aspect should be considered an irrational favorable decision for the child? First, we think we have to consider the medical information. The information itself is not mutually exclusive to health care experts as our due to the leader of opposition has talked about. They might have more changes that they experience, they might have more examples that they face throughout their medical life. But however, that does not guarantee 100% chance of them signing the right way because in these kind of life threatening situations, these half half where these chances are normally really dangerous. So even if they decide the best way that they can think half, it does not guarantee a perfectly great life for them and it can actually lead to death as well. So we believe that in whatever medical information or medical knowledge that they have, they do not guarantee 100% life chance for their child. And because this life is regarding their parents rather than the medical professionals themselves. We believe that we have to give a chance for the parents to decide what kind of medical procedure and what kind of things that they have to care about to talk about the second case, which is about understanding of the child's will. We believe this is the most important aspect in deciding what kind of mental treatment to do in somebody clients. So why is understanding the child's importance? Because in life certainly conditions it's only something like child cancer or zukomia or something like that, a very serious and serious disease. So in these kinds of cases, how the child feels due to each procedure is really important because it directly connects to the health and quality of life for long periods. So this isn't just over by one single surgery or some sort of like true surgery. It can take more than two years or three years and stuff like that. And normal average time period of these kind of diseases actually take two to three years. So when you're deciding something about two to three years of this entire child's life, then we believe that this child does not really want to do some sort of this procedure, or they don't feel comfortable doing this kind of medical procedures, then we have to respect their decision and their rights as well. And in the other cases about medical emergency where child's tense, they don't have any kind of consciousness, they have some sort of serious problem that they can't really decide anything. We believe throughout the life that their parents have lived with this child and throughout the times that they work with them. We believe that they can actually know directly on what kind of thoughts and values that this child has and this can be decided by their parents. Then why sometimes experts know these kind of child will. We believe this is because of the aspect that child can communicate more comfortably with their parents compared to the medical experts. The time the medical experts see the child is actually about two to three minutes per day. If they're in some sort of situation or if they're in the hospital themselves, they don't actually see the doctors more than 1 hour or longer like that. So we believe it's not enough time for the health expert to know with this child really? No thank you, what's this procedure? And stuff like that. However, in the case of guardians and parents, they are actually with them 24/7 mostly in these severe cases and they would have lived with this child for a certain amount of time. So we believe that they have a lot of knowledge regarding what the child really wants and those kind of aspects can lead to better decisions of their parents themselves. So we believe that the amount of information that the parents has compared to the medical information about their child is actually better in the case of their parents. Second, to talk about the benefits for the futures of child's life. We believe that because child actually has 80 90 years of child life left, we have to consider this really directly. In the case of parents, if they talk to above, parents inherently care the very best for their child, and if not, if they don't care about their child, that is trails and incelporately. So this is something that you're going to take it legally. It's not like something that we have to discuss. And in the case of health care at Frisky, they might only have great intentions and they might have better quality of life and stuff like that. But however, that does not mean that they can always make the best decision, as I said before. So we are the toughest in our later argument and also when we talk about the best decision of making the future life of patients. Life decisions actually normally have lots of side effects that can cause from the disease themselves. So in the case of leukemia, when they do this like this medical procedure from their brain taking out the liquid that's in the brain, if they take out the liquid, then there is a percentage of those child living a much longer life. But in this case, this child might get paralyzed. And those sort of side effects do exist in these kind of situations. So we believe we have to consider the parents opinion and what they want to choose. Whether they want to choose like paralyzed child or some sort of other side effects should be totally upon the parents, not the medical expert themselves. Because medical experts will not live with this child forever. But in the case apparently you have to live with them for another ten or 20 years. So we believe it's important to consider the family conditions and their situation because not every single family might be able to live with those child conditions because of their special reasons. And to talk about the second argument, we believe it's going to be too much better for medical experts in the case of the situation. In the case of doctors, yes, they might have great intentions as they talked about. However, doctors don't only meet like one or two patients a day, they have to meet if they're really famous, they have to meet about 100 patients a day. And that does not mean that they have enough time and think about each patient's best medical cases and each patient's great way to solve their health problems and stuff like that. So we will make these kind of value decisions when it is not about just living and dying and when it's something about deciding what kind of side effects they want and then something that we have to consider about the family issues and this child's will as well. We believe doctors can't make the best decisions for themselves and we believe that it's going to be a lot of work for the doctors because patients themselves can actually blame the doctors as well when something goes wrong and they can suffer from those kinds of extreme mental stress and stuff like that. So we believe that parents should have the legal bargainship towards these medical cases. Boosting or preserving wellbeing of children as we mentioned in our first speaker and we are telling you how parents and experts conflict when parents become emotional and parents are not parents become emotional about their children. We also gave you examples about religions when religious believers make side effects with their religion. So about this point of position to market, that how it's labeled and they would be legally restricted by government and however we looked at they are actually proving our point about how these religious religious believers parents can be dangerous. So we argue about how these religious believers can be dangerous in current school when they make side effects in surgeries and they just argue that our laws restrict them because side effects exist. We build that they're actually proving our point that side effects exist in surgeries when these believers make wrong decisions. So moving on to revoke firstly, beyond that there's no perfect situation how physical also children would not be guaranteed, therefore parents decision is needed. However, we also do agree with the point that perfect life, perfect situation cannot be guaranteed. However, we must always find best and most suitable decisions in life changing moment. So to make a best and suitable decision, we build the experts knowledge that's needed and an expert's decision that's needed. Isn't those parents know what yes, isn't. Those experts decision just about probable? Why do the parents have to understand what type of experts. There'S no reason why we tell you that expert's decision parents must believe experts decision whether they're thinking about expert's decision and I'm criticizing like parents are not able to understand experts knowledge and experts decision perfectly as efficient development. So therefore it's almost impossible for experts to talk about their knowledge about parents and help parents to make a racial decision. So doctors must make this decision perfect situation doesn't exist and we believe that these expertise experts knowledge can be necessary and moving on to their point of a mental condition. So, two layers of response were disappointed. Firstly. They argued that parents may be able to communicate with children and they will be able to make their mental health better. However, we actually cannot understand why this issue is related to this motion. We are just doing a medical surgery in this motion. So when we just operate these surgeries, it's not actually related to their mental health because we just operate surgeries. And however secondly even if we argue that these conditions are actually related, we looked at medical experts and parents can communicate each other and think about children's condition. So parents can talk about children's condition and children's opinion about the surgery, how they're feeling about the surgeries and symptoms and they can help doctors to make a right decision. So, what's the point doctors make rather than purpose? Even though doctors have expertise, even though doctors have expert knowledge, they are not able to know about these children's symptoms. A lot of the arguments so they can communicate. However, a lot of doctors talking about their expert knowledge to parents, these knowledge are too much for parents to know even though they communicate. Therefore, that parents talking about children's symptoms is much better. Moving on to their point about side effects and how they can minimize side effects during surgery when parents make the decision, we also believe that this point is not necessary to give emotion. Like the same as I argued before, even though parents know about children's symptoms, parents children's mental health, they are mature and they're not expert. So therefore, they are not able to make racial decisions rather than experts. Also, they argue that doctors are not able to focus on their patients because they don't have enough time to concentrate on patients. However. Even though they don't have enough time, normally two or three doctors check out patients condition and decide surgery's operation and doctors, they focuses their best and they use it a lot of time when it's a life changing moment. So, believe that these doctors decision would be the best decision. So, even though doctor's decision may not be perfect, these expert knowledge and these decisions are most suitable decisions for the situations. So, moving on to their point about legal guardianship, that legal guardianship is the reason for parents to submit. However, as we are good in our first reason, these parents rights can be restricted when parents decision can give a relative impact to propose. So, several years ago, there was this accident that caused a female idol member be at the risk of dying. So, there was two choices. First of all, if they puncture his neck, then there was more chance to live, but he had to lose his career. Another choice was that do not puncture the neck, but still it was preserved a career, but he may die. So you cannot many cases of the medical decisions are like this. There is a gray area where okay, some decisions may increase the probability of life, but that might totally ruin their quality of life. But however, other choices may ensure the quality of life but still may kill the patients. We believe that in the real world there are so many great areas like this. So therefore, we cannot simply say that oh, because doctors know well about the procedure, because doctors know well about the body, they can make the objective decisions. Therefore, that is a fundamental reason why we oppose assumption. So now we go on to several points of rebuttal against previous speakers. So first of all, the PM talked about how PM and the VPN have constantly talked about how these patients parents are not eligible enough to make objective decisions, rational decisions, and therefore they have to give the specifics to the doctors, to developers. However, we have constantly said that this information itself is not exclusive to the doctor itself. Why is this so? Because, as I've constantly told you in the POS, because these parents do not have to understand exactly how the body works, how the procedure works, but the only thing they need to know is the probabilities. Meaning that oh, if I puncture this neck, then maybe the life probability goes up to like 70% and it's not 20%. That is the only information that the patient parent needs to know to make rational decisions. And therefore we do not believe that there is special expertise needed in understanding that. And also because these people are medical experts, definitely these informations are already trusted by the parents, meaning that there is no problem in making informed and rational decisions in the house of parents. Another minor point the DPM talked about how the parents being able to communicate is not related to mental health. We're talking about medical procedures. So therefore we do not have to talk about mental health. And experts can still also communicate with the patient. However, we believe that we would like to practice we're not talking about mental health care itself, but however, we have to take care of. We have to see if which procedure can actually help better quality of life, actually help them make passion feel better. So therefore, we believe that their point is not true about the communication .2 layers a also presented as also presented by the PM of their own site. Many times this communication between the patients is impossible in the case of lifesaving procedures and B since the child's communicative skills are still lacking and they might have problems, we're talking with strangers, we're talking with people they do not have, bonding with people with that patient. Our parents are the best actors to communicate with these patients. So now I'll go on for a little more. So which case in malicious doctors or parents are more likely? We believe that doctors are much more likely. So we would like to divide this malicious kind of case into race. First of all, when the decision is objectively bad and second of all, the decision is not objectively bad, but still not preferable for the future life of the patients. So first of all, in the case where it is objectively starved so we believe that this itself is already an extreme minor case because we're talking about life threatening conditions. Meaning that even if this person, even if this parent is a religious, even if this parent maybe have a different kind of political stance or what if they have their child in the hands of dying, we believe that most of the parents would still make rational and beneficial choice for their child. So however, if there is a screen minor case where the parents do not care about their child, meaning that they are willing to even kill their child for their religion. Or in the case of health experts making objectively wrong decisions, we believe that they will be a subject for legal punishment, meaning they would be child abuse or medical accident. So therefore, we believe that this would be covered in those kinds of circumstances. Then how about a case where there is objectively, not unsafe objectively not killing the patient, but actually maybe not favorable for the patients? We believe that this is the major case of this today's debate because in real life most of the cases people would have these category areas rather than these crazy parents trying to kill their own child. So in the case of software, yeah, they do have job ethics. But however, because they are working as a job, working as a career, their career and money also matters in these kind of decisions, meaning that they have other incentives rather than patients life and future life policy itself. For example, let's say this procedure may have a lower chance of living and it is very hard and complicated. However, it would benefit the doctor's career if they have procedures. Yes, the parent might say that oh, that is true and safe, we cannot do that procedure. However, if the doctor has the whole responsibility to take these kind of decisions, they would be willing to make these kind of decisions. So therefore, we believe that, yes, even if they do have child ethics, because other factors also matter, it is still very risky. However, what about parents? Parents inherently care and love for their children. Nobody can say that oh, parents always kind of hate their children and they are willing to kill their children just because they do not have money, just because they hate their children. However, there are some kind of exceptions that we believe that is obligatory. For example, realistic burden. For example, let's say this procedure can save his child but leave his child paralyzed the rest of his life. Then, if the parent cannot take care of that children, then it is reasonable for that parent to say that oh, it is so sad for that child, but I have to make this kind of decision. So therefore, we believe that because doctors cannot take account of that but only care about other doctors who believe that the case of doctors not caring for the patient is more frequent and is more likely than the parents not caring about their own charge. Another point we would like to question the government what are doctors trained for in the very get go? What we mean by that is that objective decisions that they talk about cannot always be just. So what are they actually trained for? A information so that they can make diagnoses, they can narrow down the choices that patients have and B the skills in order to conduct lifesaving procedures, meaning that they are not trained for making value decisions like in the case of Lawrence or like judges do, they are only trained for the skills and information itself. So therefore, because still since they have the responsibility to inform their audience fully about the probability about many circumstances that might happen, we believe that the parents are already perfectly have the ability to make informed care and that is not mutually exclusive to these doctors. So we believe that the doctor's license itself does not ensure that this person can make the best decision for the patients at all times. Meaning, we would like to emphasize the fact that giving the decision itself, giving the ability to decide for the patient is talking about responsibility, not about information. Information itself can be shared very easily. Meaning that it is neither exclusive to any staff. So therefore, we believe that if these doctors have to be responsible for all of these choices, it's going to be they're not qualified to make responsibility rather than just advising them to make the right decisions. We believe that the gray areas would be a very big problem in their own space. So what happens? We told you in this debate, we believe, we have already told you how the information and skills at these experts yes, it is very good, but it is not exclusive. However, responsibility and communication with communication and representing the will of the patient itself is only exclusive for the parents. We believe that that is the main reason why we opposed to the solution. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Actually there are only a single gentleman from the sea. But however, just to be formal okay ladies and gentlemen, I found two questions in this debate. The first one is to like is it justifiable to allow medical experts to make decisions in life threatening circumstances of child? And second argument, second clash is about which side is beneficial to child, which side is able to provide a better wellbeing to individual child themselves. So although team, I mean opposition doesn't really seem to understand this clashes very well, let me just try to implement my logic to their cases. Okay? So first of all about Identifiability, we have to mention that because in life threatening conditions, since this is a problem matter of life and death, it is like there is extremely high possibility to be extremely complicated surgery or treatment being required, etc. For and therefore because parents are lacking about those experts has information and therefore medical experts should be on charge. And that was our first speaker of mentioned in our speech. However, inside of opposition, first of all, they mention that these medical informations are not exclusive to parents. However, for example, we all know how this heart donation or heart transplant plantation is happening. You just rip a random person's chest off and you just take their heart off and replace it to one another. Ladies and gentlemen, we don't necessarily know how risky it is or how much harder is or how painful it is for patients or etc for and therefore because don't thank you because there are lack of information, lack of experience, lack of those millions and thousands of cases that you or medical experts are getting educated in the university or college or whatnot. Therefore, this is just like the simple information the team opposition is arguing about the exact procedure or such statistical possibility of succeeding. With that this information is rather useless in hands of Paris, the harbor in hands of Paris and this is why we have we primarily believe that doctors should be taking charge. But however, the second response that came from team opposition is that the only information that parents need is possibility of succeed and that's all they need to make a decision. But however, Mr. Speaker, the statistical information cannot be applied to individual. If you know statistics and sized amount of it, you can know that this statistical information that is gathered by millions and thousands of patients are not directly implementable to the single patient. Maybe the problem is the doctor cannot numerically show exact possibility of success in terms of individual, especially in terms of child because every single child is in a different condition in an extreme degree. So this can be only judged by doctors, solely by doctors experience prediction and therefore, because parents does not have this and because parents are likely not are likely to be not considering those aspects showing parents statistical information such as surgery of this city is about 30%, would you do it to be reach out this kind of discussion and information given to Paris is not suitable in this case of life and a matter of life and death. So basically, in terms of the first crash, the only logic of team opposition is that information is not like information is not exclusive to doctors. And second of all, all we need is the statistical value of potential to see. However, ladies and gentlemen, I have previously mentioned that this two logic is pretty useless in this debate. So therefore we already took this first crash. More importantly, moving on to the second question about which side is beneficial to child, the team opposite should chose to argument in this gray zone of medical issues, for example choosing whether you're going to be paralyzed for your entire life or choosing or whether you're going to die a peaceful death. It could be like not people or people or whatever in this kind of case of greed zone this is not medical issues anymore. This rather issue of morality and ethics. It is rather a problem of principal value. So in this case so a discussion of doctor or parents would still be having our goal getting discharged. The doctor doesn't necessarily mean that this doctor would be able to do whatever they want without any discretion to the parents. If this is the case, it means the doctor it is okay for doctors to do biological experiments with their patients over time. This is not the kind of dog that we prefer however human but however in our sense of it. So this discussion of doctors and parents is still available. But however the point is at the end of the day anyway doctor would be able to do a doctor would be the ones who are discussing the final procedural response. So in this kind of cases of reason that team opposition was mainly trying to talk about because it is not mentor issues anymore but however, because this is more about morality and principal values boosted, doctors will be able to chose the best procedure resurgery or etc. For children by this discussion made with their own parents. However, furthermore we have mentioned that even if it's my parents or legal or child because the lack of aspects previously mentioned about their age, therapists or a huge amount of data and also because parents are having this heavy emotional tie with their own children, it is extremely hard for this parents to make irrational decision and therefore you set up as parents doctors should be taking place in charge where they can comparatively able to make a more objective decisions and what not. And therefore in our second argument of practicality you have mentioned that parents agreed to the doctors due to their irrational religious or personal beliefs such as your horse witnesses. In those cases, those childs they have a parent who believes in divorce witness or UNACCO or something, those childs will just simply die out because the parents of peer water opposition who never even allow a blood transaction which makes a surgery impossible to succeed in almost like 99% of the case. And therefore rather than letting those innocent nine year old, five or three year old child to die in a wife bed as possible but realistically rather than that you should choose doctors taking charge and therefore at least in Rs, innocent child will not die away. And therefore at the end of the day at least we would be able to save at least thousands of childs more than compared to more than the side of Team Opposition. And second of all in terms as I previously mentioned in terms of this great job which is the main weapon of Team opposition since we are not talking that we are not arguing about the doctor being able to do whatever they want no matter how parents care about the challenge and etc. Doctors and parents would be able to make a best choice for their child. And therefore we also brought to the folks.\",\n",

              "   'text': \"First of all, I would like to start off with the revolution from the government and then move on to our two main arguments. To start off with the revolution, we agree with the goal of preserving well being of the child. However, this well being does not not only need the physical wellbeing, but it also includes mental wellbeing. And in their side we can not protect the child's mental wellbeing as much as our as I can. And also regarding what the religious cases that they're talking about. Some religious might think that their religion belief and stuff like that is like the main value and things. But in our modern society, these kind of cases where they do degrees of those actions is actually considered as child abuse. And in case of this is affecting their lives directly along with their life. And if they are actually killing people because of their religious belief of their parents, then we believe that this could be considered as child abuse cases and be treated legally so they can get the help that they need. They also talked about about the justification of supporting the legal guardianship existing appearance in the Santa's Pro. There are lots of people who discuss about who to have these legal guardianship and the reason that they decided the people who have their legal guardianship is actually their guardians and parents. We believe there is some sort of reason behind it and we will explain that further on in our arguments. To start off with, before we start off with the argument, we believe that there are two characteristics of a child. First is irrationality and the second point, which is most important is that they have their life that's about 80 or 90 years in their life. So we have to consider the amount of life that they're going to live further and think of like the best way for them to live a very wonderful life in the future. So, first argument is not the doubts of qualification. What aspect should be considered an irrational favorable decision for the child? First, we think we have to consider the medical information. The information itself is not mutually exclusive to health care experts as our due to the leader of opposition has talked about. They might have more changes that they experience, they might have more examples that they face throughout their medical life. But however, that does not guarantee 100% chance of them signing the right way because in these kind of life threatening situations, these half half where these chances are normally really dangerous. So even if they decide the best way that they can think half, it does not guarantee a perfectly great life for them and it can actually lead to death as well. So we believe that in whatever medical information or medical knowledge that they have, they do not guarantee 100% life chance for their child. And because this life is regarding their parents rather than the medical professionals themselves. We believe that we have to give a chance for the parents to decide what kind of medical procedure and what kind of things that they have to care about to talk about the second case, which is about understanding of the child's will. We believe this is the most important aspect in deciding what kind of mental treatment to do in somebody clients. So why is understanding the child's importance? Because in life certainly conditions it's only something like child cancer or zukomia or something like that, a very serious and serious disease. So in these kinds of cases, how the child feels due to each procedure is really important because it directly connects to the health and quality of life for long periods. So this isn't just over by one single surgery or some sort of like true surgery. It can take more than two years or three years and stuff like that. And normal average time period of these kind of diseases actually take two to three years. So when you're deciding something about two to three years of this entire child's life, then we believe that this child does not really want to do some sort of this procedure, or they don't feel comfortable doing this kind of medical procedures, then we have to respect their decision and their rights as well. And in the other cases about medical emergency where child's tense, they don't have any kind of consciousness, they have some sort of serious problem that they can't really decide anything. We believe throughout the life that their parents have lived with this child and throughout the times that they work with them. We believe that they can actually know directly on what kind of thoughts and values that this child has and this can be decided by their parents. Then why sometimes experts know these kind of child will. We believe this is because of the aspect that child can communicate more comfortably with their parents compared to the medical experts. The time the medical experts see the child is actually about two to three minutes per day. If they're in some sort of situation or if they're in the hospital themselves, they don't actually see the doctors more than 1 hour or longer like that. So we believe it's not enough time for the health expert to know with this child really? No thank you, what's this procedure?\",\n",

              "   'text': \"However, in the case of guardians and parents, they are actually with them 24/7 mostly in these severe cases and they would have lived with this child for a certain amount of time. So we believe that they have a lot of knowledge regarding what the child really wants and those kind of aspects can lead to better decisions of their parents themselves. So we believe that the amount of information that the parents has compared to the medical information about their child is actually better in the case of their parents. Second, to talk about the benefits for the futures of child's life. We believe that because child actually has 80 90 years of child life left, we have to consider this really directly. In the case of parents, if they talk to above, parents inherently care the very best for their child, and if not, if they don't care about their child, that is trails and incelporately. So this is something that you're going to take it legally. It's not like something that we have to discuss. And in the case of health care at Frisky, they might only have great intentions and they might have better quality of life and stuff like that. But however, that does not mean that they can always make the best decision, as I said before. So we are the toughest in our later argument and also when we talk about the best decision of making the future life of patients. Life decisions actually normally have lots of side effects that can cause from the disease themselves. So in the case of leukemia, when they do this like this medical procedure from their brain taking out the liquid that's in the brain, if they take out the liquid, then there is a percentage of those child living a much longer life. But in this case, this child might get paralyzed. And those sort of side effects do exist in these kind of situations. So we believe we have to consider the parents opinion and what they want to choose. Whether they want to choose like paralyzed child or some sort of other side effects should be totally upon the parents, not the medical expert themselves. Because medical experts will not live with this child forever. But in the case apparently you have to live with them for another ten or 20 years. So we believe it's important to consider the family conditions and their situation because not every single family might be able to live with those child conditions because of their special reasons. And to talk about the second argument, we believe it's going to be too much better for medical experts in the case of the situation. In the case of doctors, yes, they might have great intentions as they talked about. However, doctors don't only meet like one or two patients a day, they have to meet if they're really famous, they have to meet about 100 patients a day. And that does not mean that they have enough time and think about each patient's best medical cases and each patient's great way to solve their health problems and stuff like that. So we will make these kind of value decisions when it is not about just living and dying and when it's something about deciding what kind of side effects they want and then something that we have to consider about the family issues and this child's will as well. We believe doctors can't make the best decisions for themselves and we believe that it's going to be a lot of work for the doctors because patients themselves can actually blame the doctors as well when something goes wrong and they can suffer from those kinds of extreme mental stress and stuff like that. So we believe that parents should have the legal bargainship towards these medical cases.\",\n",

We also gave you examples about religions when religious believers make side effects with their religion. So about this point of position to market, that how it's labeled and they would be legally restricted by government and however we looked at they are actually proving our point about how these religious religious believers parents can be dangerous. So we argue about how these religious believers can be dangerous in current school when they make side effects in surgeries and they just argue that our laws restrict them because side effects exist. We build that they're actually proving our point that side effects exist in surgeries when these believers make wrong decisions. So moving on to revoke firstly, beyond that there's no perfect situation how physical also children would not be guaranteed, therefore parents decision is needed. However, we also do agree with the point that perfect life, perfect situation cannot be guaranteed. However, we must always find best and most suitable decisions in life changing moment. So to make a best and suitable decision, we build the experts knowledge that's needed and an expert's decision that's needed. Isn't those parents know what yes, isn't.\",\n",

              "   'text': \"They argued that parents may be able to communicate with children and they will be able to make their mental health better. However, we actually cannot understand why this issue is related to this motion. We are just doing a medical surgery in this motion. So when we just operate these surgeries, it's not actually related to their mental health because we just operate surgeries. And however secondly even if we argue that these conditions are actually related, we looked at medical experts and parents can communicate each other and think about children's condition. So parents can talk about children's condition and children's opinion about the surgery, how they're feeling about the surgeries and symptoms and they can help doctors to make a right decision. So, what's the point doctors make rather than purpose? Even though doctors have expertise, even though doctors have expert knowledge, they are not able to know about these children's symptoms. A lot of the arguments so they can communicate. However, a lot of doctors talking about their expert knowledge to parents, these knowledge are too much for parents to know even though they communicate. Therefore, that parents talking about children's symptoms is much better. Moving on to their point about side effects and how they can minimize side effects during surgery when parents make the decision, we also believe that this point is not necessary to give emotion. Like the same as I argued before, even though parents know about children's symptoms, parents children's mental health, they are mature and they're not expert. So therefore, they are not able to make racial decisions rather than experts. Also, they argue that doctors are not able to focus on their patients because they don't have enough time to concentrate on patients.\",\n",

              "   'text': \"So, several years ago, there was this accident that caused a female idol member be at the risk of dying. So, there was two choices. First of all, if they puncture his neck, then there was more chance to live, but he had to lose his career. Another choice was that do not puncture the neck, but still it was preserved a career, but he may die. So you cannot many cases of the medical decisions are like this. There is a gray area where okay, some decisions may increase the probability of life, but that might totally ruin their quality of life. But however, other choices may ensure the quality of life but still may kill the patients. We believe that in the real world there are so many great areas like this. So therefore, we cannot simply say that oh, because doctors know well about the procedure, because doctors know well about the body, they can make the objective decisions. Therefore, that is a fundamental reason why we oppose assumption. So now we go on to several points of rebuttal against previous speakers. So first of all, the PM talked about how PM and the VPN have constantly talked about how these patients parents are not eligible enough to make objective decisions, rational decisions, and therefore they have to give the specifics to the doctors, to developers. However, we have constantly said that this information itself is not exclusive to the doctor itself. Why is this so? Because, as I've constantly told you in the POS, because these parents do not have to understand exactly how the body works, how the procedure works, but the only thing they need to know is the probabilities. Meaning that oh, if I puncture this neck, then maybe the life probability goes up to like 70% and it's not 20%. That is the only information that the patient parent needs to know to make rational decisions. And therefore we do not believe that there is special expertise needed in understanding that. And also because these people are medical experts, definitely these informations are already trusted by the parents, meaning that there is no problem in making informed and rational decisions in the house of parents. Another minor point the DPM talked about how the parents being able to communicate is not related to mental health. We're talking about medical procedures. So therefore we do not have to talk about mental health. And experts can still also communicate with the patient. However, we believe that we would like to practice we're not talking about mental health care itself, but however, we have to take care of. We have to see if which procedure can actually help better quality of life, actually help them make passion feel better. So therefore, we believe that their point is not true about the communication .2 layers a also presented as also presented by the PM of their own site. Many times this communication between the patients is impossible in the case of lifesaving procedures and B since the child's communicative skills are still lacking and they might have problems, we're talking with strangers, we're talking with people they do not have, bonding with people with that patient. Our parents are the best actors to communicate with these patients. So now I'll go on for a little more. So which case in malicious doctors or parents are more likely? We believe that doctors are much more likely. So we would like to divide this malicious kind of case into race. First of all, when the decision is objectively bad and second of all, the decision is not objectively bad, but still not preferable for the future life of the patients. So first of all, in the case where it is objectively starved so we believe that this itself is already an extreme minor case because we're talking about life threatening conditions. Meaning that even if this person, even if this parent is a religious, even if this parent maybe have a different kind of political stance or what if they have their child in the hands of dying, we believe that most of the parents would still make rational and beneficial choice for their child. So however, if there is a screen minor case where the parents do not care about their child, meaning that they are willing to even kill their child for their religion. Or in the case of health experts making objectively wrong decisions, we believe that they will be a subject for legal punishment, meaning they would be child abuse or medical accident. So therefore, we believe that this would be covered in those kinds of circumstances. Then how about a case where there is objectively, not unsafe objectively not killing the patient, but actually maybe not favorable for the patients? We believe that this is the major case of this today's debate because in real life most of the cases people would have these category areas rather than these crazy parents trying to kill their own child. So in the case of software, yeah, they do have job ethics. But however, because they are working as a job, working as a career, their career and money also matters in these kind of decisions, meaning that they have other incentives rather than patients life and future life policy itself. For example, let's say this procedure may have a lower chance of living and it is very hard and complicated. However, it would benefit the doctor's career if they have procedures. Yes, the parent might say that oh, that is true and safe, we cannot do that procedure. However, if the doctor has the whole responsibility to take these kind of decisions, they would be willing to make these kind of decisions. So therefore, we believe that, yes, even if they do have child ethics, because other factors also matter, it is still very risky. However, what about parents? Parents inherently care and love for their children. Nobody can say that oh, parents always kind of hate their children and they are willing to kill their children just because they do not have money, just because they hate their children. However, there are some kind of exceptions that we believe that is obligatory. For example, realistic burden. For example, let's say this procedure can save his child but leave his child paralyzed the rest of his life. Then, if the parent cannot take care of that children, then it is reasonable for that parent to say that oh, it is so sad for that child, but I have to make this kind of decision. So therefore, we believe that because doctors cannot take account of that but only care about other doctors who believe that the case of doctors not caring for the patient is more frequent and is more likely than the parents not caring about their own charge. Another point we would like to question the government what are doctors trained for in the very get go? What we mean by that is that objective decisions that they talk about cannot always be just. So what are they actually trained for? A information so that they can make diagnoses, they can narrow down the choices that patients have and B the skills in order to conduct lifesaving procedures, meaning that they are not trained for making value decisions like in the case of Lawrence or like judges do, they are only trained for the skills and information itself. So therefore, because still since they have the responsibility to inform their audience fully about the probability about many circumstances that might happen, we believe that the parents are already perfectly have the ability to make informed care and that is not mutually exclusive to these doctors. So we believe that the doctor's license itself does not ensure that this person can make the best decision for the patients at all times. Meaning, we would like to emphasize the fact that giving the decision itself, giving the ability to decide for the patient is talking about responsibility, not about information. Information itself can be shared very easily. Meaning that it is neither exclusive to any staff. So therefore, we believe that if these doctors have to be responsible for all of these choices, it's going to be they're not qualified to make responsibility rather than just advising them to make the right decisions. We believe that the gray areas would be a very big problem in their own space. So what happens? We told you in this debate, we believe, we have already told you how the information and skills at these experts yes, it is very good, but it is not exclusive. However, responsibility and communication with communication and representing the will of the patient itself is only exclusive for the parents. We believe that that is the main reason why we opposed to the solution. Thank you.\",\n",

              "   'text': \"So first of all about Identifiability, we have to mention that because in life threatening conditions, since this is a problem matter of life and death, it is like there is extremely high possibility to be extremely complicated surgery or treatment being required, etc. For and therefore because parents are lacking about those experts has information and therefore medical experts should be on charge. And that was our first speaker of mentioned in our speech. However, inside of opposition, first of all, they mention that these medical informations are not exclusive to parents. However, for example, we all know how this heart donation or heart transplant plantation is happening. You just rip a random person's chest off and you just take their heart off and replace it to one another. Ladies and gentlemen, we don't necessarily know how risky it is or how much harder is or how painful it is for patients or etc for and therefore because don't thank you because there are lack of information, lack of experience, lack of those millions and thousands of cases that you or medical experts are getting educated in the university or college or whatnot. Therefore, this is just like the simple information the team opposition is arguing about the exact procedure or such statistical possibility of succeeding. With that this information is rather useless in hands of Paris, the harbor in hands of Paris and this is why we have we primarily believe that doctors should be taking charge. But however, the second response that came from team opposition is that the only information that parents need is possibility of succeed and that's all they need to make a decision. But however, Mr. Speaker, the statistical information cannot be applied to individual. If you know statistics and sized amount of it, you can know that this statistical information that is gathered by millions and thousands of patients are not directly implementable to the single patient. Maybe the problem is the doctor cannot numerically show exact possibility of success in terms of individual, especially in terms of child because every single child is in a different condition in an extreme degree. So this can be only judged by doctors, solely by doctors experience prediction and therefore, because parents does not have this and because parents are likely not are likely to be not considering those aspects showing parents statistical information such as surgery of this city is about 30%, would you do it to be reach out this kind of discussion and information given to Paris is not suitable in this case of life and a matter of life and death. So basically, in terms of the first crash, the only logic of team opposition is that information is not like information is not exclusive to doctors. And second of all, all we need is the statistical value of potential to see. However, ladies and gentlemen, I have previously mentioned that this two logic is pretty useless in this debate. So therefore we already took this first crash. More importantly, moving on to the second question about which side is beneficial to child, the team opposite should chose to argument in this gray zone of medical issues, for example choosing whether you're going to be paralyzed for your entire life or choosing or whether you're going to die a peaceful death. It could be like not people or people or whatever in this kind of case of greed zone this is not medical issues anymore. This rather issue of morality and ethics. It is rather a problem of principal value. So in this case so a discussion of doctor or parents would still be having our goal getting discharged. The doctor doesn't necessarily mean that this doctor would be able to do whatever they want without any discretion to the parents. If this is the case, it means the doctor it is okay for doctors to do biological experiments with their patients over time. This is not the kind of dog that we prefer however human but however in our sense of it. So this discussion of doctors and parents is still available. But however the point is at the end of the day anyway doctor would be able to do a doctor would be the ones who are discussing the final procedural response. So in this kind of cases of reason that team opposition was mainly trying to talk about because it is not mentor issues anymore but however, because this is more about morality and principal values boosted, doctors will be able to chose the best procedure resurgery or etc. For children by this discussion made with their own parents. However, furthermore we have mentioned that even if it's my parents or legal or child because the lack of aspects previously mentioned about their age, therapists or a huge amount of data and also because parents are having this heavy emotional tie with their own children, it is extremely hard for this parents to make irrational decision and therefore you set up as parents doctors should be taking place in charge where they can comparatively able to make a more objective decisions and what not. And therefore in our second argument of practicality you have mentioned that parents agreed to the doctors due to their irrational religious or personal beliefs such as your horse witnesses. In those cases, those childs they have a parent who believes in divorce witness or UNACCO or something, those childs will just simply die out because the parents of peer water opposition who never even allow a blood transaction which makes a surgery impossible to succeed in almost like 99% of the case. And therefore rather than letting those innocent nine year old, five or three year old child to die in a wife bed as possible but realistically rather than that you should choose doctors taking charge and therefore at least in Rs, innocent child will not die away. And therefore at the end of the day at least we would be able to save at least thousands of childs more than compared to more than the side of Team Opposition. And second of all in terms as I previously mentioned in terms of this great job which is the main weapon of Team opposition since we are not talking that we are not arguing about the doctor being able to do whatever they want no matter how parents care about the challenge and etc. Doctors and parents would be able to make a best choice for their child. And therefore we also brought to the folks.\",\n",

              "\"First of all, I would like to start off with the revolution from the government and then move on to our two main arguments. To start off with the revolution, we agree with the goal of preserving well being of the child. However, this well being does not not only need the physical wellbeing, but it also includes mental wellbeing. And in their side we can not protect the child's mental wellbeing as much as our as I can. And also regarding what the religious cases that they're talking about. Some religious might think that their religion belief and stuff like that is like the main value and things. But in our modern society, these kind of cases where they do degrees of those actions is actually considered as child abuse. And in case of this is affecting their lives directly along with their life. And if they are actually killing people because of their religious belief of their parents, then we believe that this could be considered as child abuse cases and be treated legally so they can get the help that they need. They also talked about about the justification of supporting the legal guardianship existing appearance in the Santa's Pro. There are lots of people who discuss about who to have these legal guardianship and the reason that they decided the people who have their legal guardianship is actually their guardians and parents. We believe there is some sort of reason behind it and we will explain that further on in our arguments. To start off with, before we start off with the argument, we believe that there are two characteristics of a child. First is irrationality and the second point, which is most important is that they have their life that's about 80 or 90 years in their life. So we have to consider the amount of life that they're going to live further and think of like the best way for them to live a very wonderful life in the future. So, first argument is not the doubts of qualification. What aspect should be considered an irrational favorable decision for the child? First, we think we have to consider the medical information. The information itself is not mutually exclusive to health care experts as our due to the leader of opposition has talked about. They might have more changes that they experience, they might have more examples that they face throughout their medical life. But however, that does not guarantee 100% chance of them signing the right way because in these kind of life threatening situations, these half half where these chances are normally really dangerous. So even if they decide the best way that they can think half, it does not guarantee a perfectly great life for them and it can actually lead to death as well. So we believe that in whatever medical information or medical knowledge that they have, they do not guarantee 100% life chance for their child. And because this life is regarding their parents rather than the medical professionals themselves. We believe that we have to give a chance for the parents to decide what kind of medical procedure and what kind of things that they have to care about to talk about the second case, which is about understanding of the child's will. We believe this is the most important aspect in deciding what kind of mental treatment to do in somebody clients. So why is understanding the child's importance? Because in life certainly conditions it's only something like child cancer or zukomia or something like that, a very serious and serious disease. So in these kinds of cases, how the child feels due to each procedure is really important because it directly connects to the health and quality of life for long periods. So this isn't just over by one single surgery or some sort of like true surgery. It can take more than two years or three years and stuff like that. And normal average time period of these kind of diseases actually take two to three years. So when you're deciding something about two to three years of this entire child's life, then we believe that this child does not really want to do some sort of this procedure, or they don't feel comfortable doing this kind of medical procedures, then we have to respect their decision and their rights as well. And in the other cases about medical emergency where child's tense, they don't have any kind of consciousness, they have some sort of serious problem that they can't really decide anything. We believe throughout the life that their parents have lived with this child and throughout the times that they work with them. We believe that they can actually know directly on what kind of thoughts and values that this child has and this can be decided by their parents. Then why sometimes experts know these kind of child will. We believe this is because of the aspect that child can communicate more comfortably with their parents compared to the medical experts. The time the medical experts see the child is actually about two to three minutes per day. If they're in some sort of situation or if they're in the hospital themselves, they don't actually see the doctors more than 1 hour or longer like that. So we believe it's not enough time for the health expert to know with this child really? No thank you, what's this procedure? And stuff like that. However, in the case of guardians and parents, they are actually with them 24/7 mostly in these severe cases and they would have lived with this child for a certain amount of time. So we believe that they have a lot of knowledge regarding what the child really wants and those kind of aspects can lead to better decisions of their parents themselves. So we believe that the amount of information that the parents has compared to the medical information about their child is actually better in the case of their parents. Second, to talk about the benefits for the futures of child's life. We believe that because child actually has 80 90 years of child life left, we have to consider this really directly. In the case of parents, if they talk to above, parents inherently care the very best for their child, and if not, if they don't care about their child, that is trails and incelporately. So this is something that you're going to take it legally. It's not like something that we have to discuss. And in the case of health care at Frisky, they might only have great intentions and they might have better quality of life and stuff like that. But however, that does not mean that they can always make the best decision, as I said before. So we are the toughest in our later argument and also when we talk about the best decision of making the future life of patients. Life decisions actually normally have lots of side effects that can cause from the disease themselves. So in the case of leukemia, when they do this like this medical procedure from their brain taking out the liquid that's in the brain, if they take out the liquid, then there is a percentage of those child living a much longer life. But in this case, this child might get paralyzed. And those sort of side effects do exist in these kind of situations. So we believe we have to consider the parents opinion and what they want to choose. Whether they want to choose like paralyzed child or some sort of other side effects should be totally upon the parents, not the medical expert themselves. Because medical experts will not live with this child forever. But in the case apparently you have to live with them for another ten or 20 years. So we believe it's important to consider the family conditions and their situation because not every single family might be able to live with those child conditions because of their special reasons. And to talk about the second argument, we believe it's going to be too much better for medical experts in the case of the situation. In the case of doctors, yes, they might have great intentions as they talked about. However, doctors don't only meet like one or two patients a day, they have to meet if they're really famous, they have to meet about 100 patients a day. And that does not mean that they have enough time and think about each patient's best medical cases and each patient's great way to solve their health problems and stuff like that. So we will make these kind of value decisions when it is not about just living and dying and when it's something about deciding what kind of side effects they want and then something that we have to consider about the family issues and this child's will as well. We believe doctors can't make the best decisions for themselves and we believe that it's going to be a lot of work for the doctors because patients themselves can actually blame the doctors as well when something goes wrong and they can suffer from those kinds of extreme mental stress and stuff like that. So we believe that parents should have the legal bargainship towards these medical cases. Boosting or preserving wellbeing of children as we mentioned in our first speaker and we are telling you how parents and experts conflict when parents become emotional and parents are not parents become emotional about their children. We also gave you examples about religions when religious believers make side effects with their religion. So about this point of position to market, that how it's labeled and they would be legally restricted by government and however we looked at they are actually proving our point about how these religious religious believers parents can be dangerous. So we argue about how these religious believers can be dangerous in current school when they make side effects in surgeries and they just argue that our laws restrict them because side effects exist. We build that they're actually proving our point that side effects exist in surgeries when these believers make wrong decisions. So moving on to revoke firstly, beyond that there's no perfect situation how physical also children would not be guaranteed, therefore parents decision is needed. However, we also do agree with the point that perfect life, perfect situation cannot be guaranteed. However, we must always find best and most suitable decisions in life changing moment. So to make a best and suitable decision, we build the experts knowledge that's needed and an expert's decision that's needed. Isn't those parents know what yes, isn't. Those experts decision just about probable? Why do the parents have to understand what type of experts. There'S no reason why we tell you that expert's decision parents must believe experts decision whether they're thinking about expert's decision and I'm criticizing like parents are not able to understand experts knowledge and experts decision perfectly as efficient development. So therefore it's almost impossible for experts to talk about their knowledge about parents and help parents to make a racial decision. So doctors must make this decision perfect situation doesn't exist and we believe that these expertise experts knowledge can be necessary and moving on to their point of a mental condition. So, two layers of response were disappointed. Firstly. They argued that parents may be able to communicate with children and they will be able to make their mental health better. However, we actually cannot understand why this issue is related to this motion. We are just doing a medical surgery in this motion. So when we just operate these surgeries, it's not actually related to their mental health because we just operate surgeries. And however secondly even if we argue that these conditions are actually related, we looked at medical experts and parents can communicate each other and think about children's condition. So parents can talk about children's condition and children's opinion about the surgery, how they're feeling about the surgeries and symptoms and they can help doctors to make a right decision. So, what's the point doctors make rather than purpose? Even though doctors have expertise, even though doctors have expert knowledge, they are not able to know about these children's symptoms. A lot of the arguments so they can communicate. However, a lot of doctors talking about their expert knowledge to parents, these knowledge are too much for parents to know even though they communicate. Therefore, that parents talking about children's symptoms is much better. Moving on to their point about side effects and how they can minimize side effects during surgery when parents make the decision, we also believe that this point is not necessary to give emotion. Like the same as I argued before, even though parents know about children's symptoms, parents children's mental health, they are mature and they're not expert. So therefore, they are not able to make racial decisions rather than experts. Also, they argue that doctors are not able to focus on their patients because they don't have enough time to concentrate on patients. However. Even though they don't have enough time, normally two or three doctors check out patients condition and decide surgery's operation and doctors, they focuses their best and they use it a lot of time when it's a life changing moment. So, believe that these doctors decision would be the best decision. So, even though doctor's decision may not be perfect, these expert knowledge and these decisions are most suitable decisions for the situations. So, moving on to their point about legal guardianship, that legal guardianship is the reason for parents to submit. However, as we are good in our first reason, these parents rights can be restricted when parents decision can give a relative impact to propose. So, several years ago, there was this accident that caused a female idol member be at the risk of dying. So, there was two choices. First of all, if they puncture his neck, then there was more chance to live, but he had to lose his career. Another choice was that do not puncture the neck, but still it was preserved a career, but he may die. So you cannot many cases of the medical decisions are like this. There is a gray area where okay, some decisions may increase the probability of life, but that might totally ruin their quality of life. But however, other choices may ensure the quality of life but still may kill the patients. We believe that in the real world there are so many great areas like this. So therefore, we cannot simply say that oh, because doctors know well about the procedure, because doctors know well about the body, they can make the objective decisions. Therefore, that is a fundamental reason why we oppose assumption. So now we go on to several points of rebuttal against previous speakers. So first of all, the PM talked about how PM and the VPN have constantly talked about how these patients parents are not eligible enough to make objective decisions, rational decisions, and therefore they have to give the specifics to the doctors, to developers. However, we have constantly said that this information itself is not exclusive to the doctor itself. Why is this so? Because, as I've constantly told you in the POS, because these parents do not have to understand exactly how the body works, how the procedure works, but the only thing they need to know is the probabilities. Meaning that oh, if I puncture this neck, then maybe the life probability goes up to like 70% and it's not 20%. That is the only information that the patient parent needs to know to make rational decisions. And therefore we do not believe that there is special expertise needed in understanding that. And also because these people are medical experts, definitely these informations are already trusted by the parents, meaning that there is no problem in making informed and rational decisions in the house of parents. Another minor point the DPM talked about how the parents being able to communicate is not related to mental health. We're talking about medical procedures. So therefore we do not have to talk about mental health. And experts can still also communicate with the patient. However, we believe that we would like to practice we're not talking about mental health care itself, but however, we have to take care of. We have to see if which procedure can actually help better quality of life, actually help them make passion feel better. So therefore, we believe that their point is not true about the communication .2 layers a also presented as also presented by the PM of their own site. Many times this communication between the patients is impossible in the case of lifesaving procedures and B since the child's communicative skills are still lacking and they might have problems, we're talking with strangers, we're talking with people they do not have, bonding with people with that patient. Our parents are the best actors to communicate with these patients. So now I'll go on for a little more. So which case in malicious doctors or parents are more likely? We believe that doctors are much more likely. So we would like to divide this malicious kind of case into race. First of all, when the decision is objectively bad and second of all, the decision is not objectively bad, but still not preferable for the future life of the patients. So first of all, in the case where it is objectively starved so we believe that this itself is already an extreme minor case because we're talking about life threatening conditions. Meaning that even if this person, even if this parent is a religious, even if this parent maybe have a different kind of political stance or what if they have their child in the hands of dying, we believe that most of the parents would still make rational and beneficial choice for their child. So however, if there is a screen minor case where the parents do not care about their child, meaning that they are willing to even kill their child for their religion. Or in the case of health experts making objectively wrong decisions, we believe that they will be a subject for legal punishment, meaning they would be child abuse or medical accident. So therefore, we believe that this would be covered in those kinds of circumstances. Then how about a case where there is objectively, not unsafe objectively not killing the patient, but actually maybe not favorable for the patients? We believe that this is the major case of this today's debate because in real life most of the cases people would have these category areas rather than these crazy parents trying to kill their own child. So in the case of software, yeah, they do have job ethics. But however, because they are working as a job, working as a career, their career and money also matters in these kind of decisions, meaning that they have other incentives rather than patients life and future life policy itself. For example, let's say this procedure may have a lower chance of living and it is very hard and complicated. However, it would benefit the doctor's career if they have procedures. Yes, the parent might say that oh, that is true and safe, we cannot do that procedure. However, if the doctor has the whole responsibility to take these kind of decisions, they would be willing to make these kind of decisions. So therefore, we believe that, yes, even if they do have child ethics, because other factors also matter, it is still very risky. However, what about parents? Parents inherently care and love for their children. Nobody can say that oh, parents always kind of hate their children and they are willing to kill their children just because they do not have money, just because they hate their children. However, there are some kind of exceptions that we believe that is obligatory. For example, realistic burden. For example, let's say this procedure can save his child but leave his child paralyzed the rest of his life. Then, if the parent cannot take care of that children, then it is reasonable for that parent to say that oh, it is so sad for that child, but I have to make this kind of decision. So therefore, we believe that because doctors cannot take account of that but only care about other doctors who believe that the case of doctors not caring for the patient is more frequent and is more likely than the parents not caring about their own charge. Another point we would like to question the government what are doctors trained for in the very get go? What we mean by that is that objective decisions that they talk about cannot always be just. So what are they actually trained for? A information so that they can make diagnoses, they can narrow down the choices that patients have and B the skills in order to conduct lifesaving procedures, meaning that they are not trained for making value decisions like in the case of Lawrence or like judges do, they are only trained for the skills and information itself. So therefore, because still since they have the responsibility to inform their audience fully about the probability about many circumstances that might happen, we believe that the parents are already perfectly have the ability to make informed care and that is not mutually exclusive to these doctors. So we believe that the doctor's license itself does not ensure that this person can make the best decision for the patients at all times. Meaning, we would like to emphasize the fact that giving the decision itself, giving the ability to decide for the patient is talking about responsibility, not about information. Information itself can be shared very easily. Meaning that it is neither exclusive to any staff. So therefore, we believe that if these doctors have to be responsible for all of these choices, it's going to be they're not qualified to make responsibility rather than just advising them to make the right decisions. We believe that the gray areas would be a very big problem in their own space. So what happens? We told you in this debate, we believe, we have already told you how the information and skills at these experts yes, it is very good, but it is not exclusive. However, responsibility and communication with communication and representing the will of the patient itself is only exclusive for the parents. We believe that that is the main reason why we opposed to the solution. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Actually there are only a single gentleman from the sea. But however, just to be formal okay ladies and gentlemen, I found two questions in this debate. The first one is to like is it justifiable to allow medical experts to make decisions in life threatening circumstances of child? And second argument, second clash is about which side is beneficial to child, which side is able to provide a better wellbeing to individual child themselves. So although team, I mean opposition doesn't really seem to understand this clashes very well, let me just try to implement my logic to their cases. Okay? So first of all about Identifiability, we have to mention that because in life threatening conditions, since this is a problem matter of life and death, it is like there is extremely high possibility to be extremely complicated surgery or treatment being required, etc. For and therefore because parents are lacking about those experts has information and therefore medical experts should be on charge. And that was our first speaker of mentioned in our speech. However, inside of opposition, first of all, they mention that these medical informations are not exclusive to parents. However, for example, we all know how this heart donation or heart transplant plantation is happening. You just rip a random person's chest off and you just take their heart off and replace it to one another. Ladies and gentlemen, we don't necessarily know how risky it is or how much harder is or how painful it is for patients or etc for and therefore because don't thank you because there are lack of information, lack of experience, lack of those millions and thousands of cases that you or medical experts are getting educated in the university or college or whatnot. Therefore, this is just like the simple information the team opposition is arguing about the exact procedure or such statistical possibility of succeeding. With that this information is rather useless in hands of Paris, the harbor in hands of Paris and this is why we have we primarily believe that doctors should be taking charge. But however, the second response that came from team opposition is that the only information that parents need is possibility of succeed and that's all they need to make a decision. But however, Mr. Speaker, the statistical information cannot be applied to individual. If you know statistics and sized amount of it, you can know that this statistical information that is gathered by millions and thousands of patients are not directly implementable to the single patient. Maybe the problem is the doctor cannot numerically show exact possibility of success in terms of individual, especially in terms of child because every single child is in a different condition in an extreme degree. So this can be only judged by doctors, solely by doctors experience prediction and therefore, because parents does not have this and because parents are likely not are likely to be not considering those aspects showing parents statistical information such as surgery of this city is about 30%, would you do it to be reach out this kind of discussion and information given to Paris is not suitable in this case of life and a matter of life and death. So basically, in terms of the first crash, the only logic of team opposition is that information is not like information is not exclusive to doctors. And second of all, all we need is the statistical value of potential to see. However, ladies and gentlemen, I have previously mentioned that this two logic is pretty useless in this debate. So therefore we already took this first crash. More importantly, moving on to the second question about which side is beneficial to child, the team opposite should chose to argument in this gray zone of medical issues, for example choosing whether you're going to be paralyzed for your entire life or choosing or whether you're going to die a peaceful death. It could be like not people or people or whatever in this kind of case of greed zone this is not medical issues anymore. This rather issue of morality and ethics. It is rather a problem of principal value. So in this case so a discussion of doctor or parents would still be having our goal getting discharged. The doctor doesn't necessarily mean that this doctor would be able to do whatever they want without any discretion to the parents. If this is the case, it means the doctor it is okay for doctors to do biological experiments with their patients over time. This is not the kind of dog that we prefer however human but however in our sense of it. So this discussion of doctors and parents is still available. But however the point is at the end of the day anyway doctor would be able to do a doctor would be the ones who are discussing the final procedural response. So in this kind of cases of reason that team opposition was mainly trying to talk about because it is not mentor issues anymore but however, because this is more about morality and principal values boosted, doctors will be able to chose the best procedure resurgery or etc. For children by this discussion made with their own parents. However, furthermore we have mentioned that even if it's my parents or legal or child because the lack of aspects previously mentioned about their age, therapists or a huge amount of data and also because parents are having this heavy emotional tie with their own children, it is extremely hard for this parents to make irrational decision and therefore you set up as parents doctors should be taking place in charge where they can comparatively able to make a more objective decisions and what not. And therefore in our second argument of practicality you have mentioned that parents agreed to the doctors due to their irrational religious or personal beliefs such as your horse witnesses. In those cases, those childs they have a parent who believes in divorce witness or UNACCO or something, those childs will just simply die out because the parents of peer water opposition who never even allow a blood transaction which makes a surgery impossible to succeed in almost like 99% of the case. And therefore rather than letting those innocent nine year old, five or three year old child to die in a wife bed as possible but realistically rather than that you should choose doctors taking charge and therefore at least in Rs, innocent child will not die away. And therefore at the end of the day at least we would be able to save at least thousands of childs more than compared to more than the side of Team Opposition. And second of all in terms as I previously mentioned in terms of this great job which is the main weapon of Team opposition since we are not talking that we are not arguing about the doctor being able to do whatever they want no matter how parents care about the challenge and etc. Doctors and parents would be able to make a best choice for their child. And therefore we also brought to the folks.\""
